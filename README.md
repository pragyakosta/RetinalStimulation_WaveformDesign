# RetinalStimulation_WaveformDesign

1) Admittance Method c++ code (mesher, netgen, solver and interpv
2) Neuron simulation code - Applies AM generated (electrical stimulation) voltages at all compartments of RC1 (retinal connectome from Dr. Jones's group) network and simulates the network level response (observed at ganglion cell 606).
